# ML-sample
I upload my Machine Learning code for sample datasets and various projects here.
I have both Supervised and Unsupervised learning here.
For Supervised Learning, usually I try different algorithms such as Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVM and ...
As for Unsupervised Learning I try K Means Clustering, DBSCAN and PCA
I use the datasets on found on Kaggle
